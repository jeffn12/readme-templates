# Application Name

Short description of what the app is. What does it do?  Why did you build it?

## Getting Started

What does the user need to do before they even clone/fork your repo in order to make sure it works?  Do they need to have a specific environment installed?  Let them know early on what kind of setup they are in for.

### Installation

Tell the user how to get your application from wherever it is hosted, and how to install/setup so that it is ready to use

### Usage

Give some basic instructions on how to use the application once it is running.  If there is anything cool or special about your app, point it out here to make sure the user knows to try it out.

## Dependencies

What libraries does your application use?  What will it install on the user computer if they build locally?

## Thanks
